Prototype for creating enemy agents for game design class

Note: There are still bugs with the interactions between the enemy agents

The contents of the DataStructures folder in Scripts is all taken from https://github.com/erdiizgi/DSUnity
(This was used to be able to use a PriorityQueue in my A* implementation)
